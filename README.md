I learn multi object detection from https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Object-Detection/blob/master/detect.py 
I changed the code a bit, first I changed the utilities.py to prepare my custom data that generated by myself from roboflow, secondly I changed the model.py to detect only small objects
